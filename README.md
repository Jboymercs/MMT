# Contributing

To contribute, all you need to do is make a pull request based on the current release branch (currently 0.4.1).
Please explain in detail what your pull request is changing. Then I will test and review your code. I may merge it in after
looking at it, or I may have some suggestions or questions, so keep an eye on your pull request after requesting to merge it in.

Also, if it is a major change, you probably want to make an issue in the issue tracker, and I will look
at it, and we can discuss from there.
